# NY CitiBike Sharing

## Overview 

### Analysis

The New York Citi Bike Data was imported to jupyter notebook where the data was cleaned and ready for graphycal analysis. The graphycal analysis was done in Tableau, the data was represented graphically for better vidualizations and exploration of bike sharing app.

# Graphical Result

From the graphical results it was easy to explain which gender picks up more bikes and with the hours of the day. Also it it tells if the rides are more during the weekdays, weekends. Below are some graphical presentation that explains bike rides in NY City visually.

The graph above is a Checkout times by gender, it shows which gender takes more rides. The yellow line represent the male, the blue line represent the female, while the red line represent none. From that graph we can see male take more rides every minute.

The graph above represent trips by weekend per hour, the darker colors and lighter colors indicate rides. The darker part in the graph simply implies more rides are taken during those period. The most profitable rides of the week are around 7AM to 9AM and 5PM to 7PM.

The above graph shows rides by gender. The times corrolate to the above time in trips by weekend per hour, looking at the graph it is graphical obvious that male gets more rides than other gender. 

# Summary
Taking bike rides is a well known form of short distance transportation in Ney York due to high traffic in the city. The NY CitiBike analysis was done with all visuals that enable one see which gender rides bikes the most, time period during the week and weekends that rides are high. From this analysis one can conclude that more bikes should be made available during its peak hours and month which will increase income. Two additional visualization was done using gender and the month of January. I used the month of January because the weather is cold but it shows more males ride backs during winter than any other gender, the female gender riding bikes reduces during the cold period.
